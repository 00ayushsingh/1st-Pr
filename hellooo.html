       There were four heroes as it were in the previous generation and one of<br />
       them betrayed the others, and then there were the three. So I wanted<br />
        Harry to be surrounded by... James and Sirius and Lupin, all of whom<br />
        had died in a way for him. You know Lupin had laid down his life in<br />
        Harry's battle, he didn't have to come back, he didn't have to fight.<br />
        James had died trying to protect the family; Sirius very obviously had<br />
        died fighting along with Harry."<br />
